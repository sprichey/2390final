    <h1>Spring Flowers</h1>
    <p>Spring has officially sprung and with it comes the arrival of sunshine, warmer temps and most importantly, blossoms! It’s also a time to reflect, reset and work on being your best self. And we found just the place to hone your newfound Zen—a garden. Science shows that spending time outdoors, particularly amongst nature’s most beautiful blooms can significantly improve positive energy, reduce stress, and boost productivity. Experiencing pleasing colors and scents (even a small bouquet can help!) can create positive mental health effects. Everything from increased enjoyment of the world, to deeper social connections, and increased life satisfaction can come from some time spent with flowers. Studies have found that natural environments can improve memory and attention by as much as 20 percent. Which means if you’re looking for the perfect spot for a treasured memory, like, say, a big question involving a ring, a flower garden should be on your short list.</p><br>

    <p>We’ve all heard the saying, “stop and smell the roses.” While it might seem cliché, the advice is actually worth taking, particularly when life feels frenzied. That’s because exposure to flowers can relax you, make you feel more comfortable and natural, and even lower your heart rate. Given the long-term negative effects that stress can have on the body, from an increased rate of heart attacks to accelerated aging, that time-worn saying might be a bit more meaningful than you think.</p><br><br><br><br>
